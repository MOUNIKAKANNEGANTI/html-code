    <p>
        Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage
        centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of Tamil Nadu.
        His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque;[9] his mother Ashiamma was
        a housewife.[10][11][12][13] His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram
        and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi.[14][15]

    </ul>

    <br>
    Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one sister in his family.[16][17][18] His ancestors had been wealthy
    Marakayar traders and landowners, with numerous properties and large tracts of land. Marakayar are a Muslim
    ethnic
    group found in coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descent from Arab traders and local women. The family
    business
    had involved trading groceries between the mainland and the island and to and from Sri Lanka, as well as
    ferrying pilgrims
    between the mainland and Pamban. With the opening of the Pamban Bridge to the mainland in 1914, however, the
    businesses failed
    and the family fortune and properties were lost by the 1920s, apart from the ancestral home. The family was
    poverty-stricken by
    the time Kalam was born. As a young boy he had to sell newspapers to add to the family's meager income.

    <h2 id="education">EDUCATION</h2>
    <p>
        In his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as a bright and hardworking student who had a
        strong desire to learn.
        He spent hours on his studies, especially Mathematics.[21] After completing his education at Schwartz Higher
        Secondary School,
        Ramanathapuram, Kalam went on to attend the St. Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli from where he graduated in
        Physics in 1954.[22]

        <br>
        Kalam moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering in Madras Institute of Technology.[13] While Kalam
        was working on a
        senior class project, the Dean was dissatisfied with his lack of progress and threatened to revoke his
        scholarship unless the project
        was finished within the next three days. Kalam met the deadline, impressing the Dean, who later said to him, "I
        was putting you under
        stress and asking you to meet a difficult deadline."[23] He narrowly missed achieving his dream of becoming a
        fighter pilot, as he placed
        ninth in qualifiers, and only eight positions were available in the IAF.[24]
        <br>
    <h3>Career as a scientist</h3>
    This was my first stage, in which I learnt leadership from three great teachers—Dr Vikram Sarabhai, Prof Satish
    Dhawan and Dr Brahm Prakash.
    This was the time of learning and acquisition of knowledge for me. A P J Abdul Kalam[25]After graduating from the
    Madras
    Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research and
    Development Organisation
    (by Press Information Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research &
    Development Service (DRDS).
    He started his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO.[26]
    Kalam joined the INCOSPAR,
    working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist.[13] He was interviewed and recruited into ISRO by H. G.
    S. Murthy, the first Director
    of Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS).[27] In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space
    Research Organisation (ISRO) where he
    was the project director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini
    satellite in near-earth orbit in
    July 1980; Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965.[1] In 1969,
    Kalam received the government's approval
    and expanded the programme to include more engineers.[25]
    </p>
    <h2 id="service">SERVICE</h2>
    <p>
        Kalam served as the 11th president of India, succeeding K. R. Narayanan. He won the 2002 presidential election
        with an electoral
        vote of 922,884,surpassing the 107,366 votes won by Lakshmi Sahgal. His term lasted from 25 July 2002, to 25
        July 2007.[39]
        <br>
        On 10 June 2002, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) which was in power at the time, expressed that they
        would nominate
        Kalam for the post of President,[40][41] and both the Samajwadi Party and the Nationalist Congress Party backed
        his candidacy.[42][43]
        After the Samajwadi Party announced its support for Kalam, Narayanan chose not to seek a second term in office,
        leaving the field clear.[44]
        Kalam said of the announcement of his candidature:
        <br>
        I am really overwhelmed. Everywhere both in Internet and in other media, I have been asked for a message. I was
        thinking what message
        I can give to the people of the country at this juncture.[45]
        <br>
        On 18 June, Kalam filed his nomination papers in the Indian Parliament, accompanied by Vajpayee and his senior
        Cabinet colleagues.[46]
        <br>
        The polling for the presidential election began on 15 July 2002, in Parliament and the state assemblies, with
        the media claiming that the
        election was a one-sided affair and Kalam's victory was a foregone conclusion; the count was held on 18
        July.[47] Kalam became the 11th
        president of the Republic of India in an easy victory,[48] and moved into the Rashtrapati Bhavan after he was
        sworn in on 25 July.[49]
        Kalam was the third President of India to have been honoured with a Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian
        honour, before becoming the
        President Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan (1954) and Zakir Husain (1963) were the earlier recipients of Bharat Ratna
        who later became the
        President of India.[50] He was also the first scientist and the first bachelor to occupy Rashtrapati Bhawan.[51]
        <br>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/A.P.J_Abdul_Kalam.png" alt="" width="20%">
        <br>
        During his term as president, he was affectionately known as the People's President,[52][53][54] saying that
        signing the Office of Profit
        Bill was the toughest decision he had taken during his tenure.[55][56][57] Kalam was criticised for his inaction
        in deciding the fate of
        20 out of the 21 mercy petitions submitted to him during his tenure.[58] Article 72 of the Constitution of India
        empowers the President of
        India to grant pardons, and suspend or commute the death sentence of convicts on death row.[58][59] Kalam acted
        on only one mercy plea in
        his five-year tenure as president, rejecting the plea of rapist Dhananjoy Chatterjee, who was later hanged.[58]
        Perhaps the most notable
        plea was from Afzal Guru, a Kashmiri terrorist who was convicted of conspiracy in the December 2001 attack on
        the Indian Parliament and
        was sentenced to death by the Supreme Court of India in 2004.[59] While the sentence was scheduled to be carried
        out on 20 October 2006,
        the pending action on his mercy plea resulted in him remaining on death row.[59] He also took the controversial
        decision to impose President's
        Rule in Bihar in 2005.[60]
        <br>
        In September 2003, in an interactive session in PGI Chandigarh, Kalam supported the need of Uniform Civil Code
        in India, keeping in view
        the population of the country.[61][62][63][64]
        <br>
        At the end of his term, on 20 June 2007, Kalam expressed his willingness to consider a second term in office
        provided there was certainty
        about his victory in the 2007 presidential election.[65] However, two days later, he decided not to contest the
        Presidential election again
        stating that he wanted to avoid involving Rashtrapati Bhavan from any political processes.[66] He was proposed
        by third front named United
        National Progressive Alliance leader J. Jayalalithaa and coordinator Chandrababu Naidu other leaders Mulayam
        Singh Yadav and Om Prakash
        Chautala, but he did not have the support of the left parties, Shiv Sena and UPA constituents, to receive a
        renewed mandate.[67][68]
        <br>
        Nearing the expiry of the term of the 12th President Pratibha Patil on 24 July 2012, media reports in April
        claimed that Kalam was likely
        to be nominated for his second term.[69][70][71] After the reports, social networking sites witnessed a number
        of people supporting his
        candidature.[72][73] The BJP potentially backed his nomination[failed verification], saying that the party would
        lend their support if the
        Trinamool Congress, Samajwadi Party and Indian National Congress proposed him for the 2012 presidential
        election.[74][75] A month ahead of
        the election, Mulayam Singh Yadav and Mamata Banerjee also expressed their support for Kalam.[76] Indian
        National Congress opposed the
        nomination of Kalam in 2012.[77] Days afterwards, Mulayam Singh Yadav backed out, leaving Mamata Banerjee as the
        solitary supporter.[78]
        On 18 June 2012, Kalam declined to contest the 2012 presidential poll. He said of his decision not to do so:
        <br>
        Many, many citizens have also expressed the same wish. It only reflects their love and affection for me and the
        aspiration of the people.
        I am really overwhelmed by this support. This being their wish, I respect it. I want to thank them for the trust
        they have in me.[79]

    <h3>Post-presidency</h3>
    After leaving office, Kalam became a visiting professor at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, the Indian
    Institute of Management
    Ahmedabad, and the Indian Institute of Management Indore; an honorary fellow of Indian Institute of Science,
    Bangalore;[80] chancellor of
    the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology Thiruvananthapuram; professor of Aerospace Engineering at Anna
    University; and an
    adjunct at many other academic and research institutions across India. He taught information technology at the
    International Institute of
    Information Technology, Hyderabad, and technology at Banaras Hindu University and Anna University.[81]
    <br>
    In May 2012, Kalam launched a programme for the youth of India called the What Can I Give Movement, with a central
    theme of defeating
    corruption.[84][85]

    <h2 id="awards">AWARDS</h2>
    <p>
        Kalam received 7 honorary doctorates from 40 universities.[152][153] The Government of India honoured him with
        the Padma Bhushan in 1981
        and the Padma Vibhushan in 1990 for his work with ISRO and DRDO and his role as a scientific advisor to the
        Government.[154] In 1997,
        Kalam received India's highest civilian honour, the Bharat Ratna, for his contribution to the scientific
        research and modernisation of
        defence technology in India.[155] In 2008 Kalam was the recipient of Hoover Medal.[156] And in 2013, he was the
        recipient of the Von
        Braun Award from the National Space Society "to recognize excellence in the management and leadership of a
        space-related project".[157
        <br>
        In 2012, Kalam was ranked number 2 in Outlook India's poll of the Greatest Indian.[158]
        <br>
        Following his death, Kalam received numerous tributes. The Tamil Nadu state government announced that his
        birthday, 15 October, would be
        observed across the state as "Youth Renaissance Day;" the state government further instituted the "Dr. A. P. J.
        Abdul Kalam Award",
        constituting an 8-gram gold medal, a certificate and ₹500,000 (US$6,000). The award will be awarded annually on
        Independence Day,
        beginning in 2015, to residents of the state with achievements in promoting scientific growth, the humanities or
        the welfare of students.[159]
        <br>
        On the anniversary of Kalam's birth in 2015 the CBSE set topics on his name in the CBSE expression series.[160]
